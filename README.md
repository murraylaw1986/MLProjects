## 🚗 Carvana Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

![Carvana](/car.png)

Welcome to the **Carvana Car Price Prediction** project! This repository walks you through building a robust machine learning pipeline using Python to predict car prices based on real-world data. You'll clean and preprocess the dataset, apply encoding techniques, and train predictive models like **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**.

## 📌 Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing with **Pandas**
* Handling categorical variables using:

  * One-Hot Encoding
  * Label Encoding
* Training and comparing:

  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest Regressor
* Evaluation using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
* Hosted in **Google Colab** for an interactive, cloud-based experience

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

* Python 🐍
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Google Colab
